# Wellness Room Expansion Project

**University of Toronto - APS112 Conceptual Design Specification (CDS)**  
**Team #121**  
**Date:** March 25, 2024

## Project Overview

The Wellness Room Expansion Project aims to redesign the wellness space at the University of Toronto’s Chestnut Residence to better support mental well-being and user comfort. Currently underutilized, the room lacks features conducive to relaxation and wellness. This project proposes a more inviting, functional space that encourages rest, mental restoration, and wellness activities for students and staff.

## Project Goals

1. **Create an Inviting Atmosphere:** A space that feels open, calm, and supportive of mental wellness.
2. **Maximize Usability:** Expand the available area by incorporating the adjacent study room.
3. **Enhance Comfort:** Address auditory, lighting, and seating arrangements to create a distraction-free, comfortable environment.
4. **Encourage Community and Individual Wellness Activities:** Facilitate both personal relaxation and community-oriented wellness events.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Client:** Lucy Chandler, Residence Life Coordinator
- **Key Users:** 75% undergraduate first-year students, UofT wellness staff, and UofT student organizations.

## Design Process

The team generated over 80 design components and consolidated them into three potential solutions, each offering unique wellness benefits. These were evaluated through multi-voting, a decision chart, and the Pugh method, with the final recommendation being **Nature’s Haven**, which best aligns with the project’s wellness and comfort goals.

### Design Alternatives

1. **EasyLife Wellness**
   - Focuses on cognitive stimulation through leisure activities.
   - Features include gym mats, a swing chair, and entertainment items like books and music.

2. **Nature’s Haven** (Recommended Design)
   - Creates a simulated natural environment using biophilic elements such as synthetic grass, an aroma diffuser, and an indoor fountain.
   - Promotes relaxation through calming, nature-inspired auditory and visual stimuli.

3. **DuoFusion Chambers**
   - Divides the room into two flexible spaces using a movable bookshelf, catering to both personal and community wellness needs.
   - Focuses on soundproofing and customizable space for distraction-free relaxation.

## Recommended Solution: Nature’s Haven

The **Nature’s Haven** design was selected for its alignment with key wellness criteria: lighting, comfort, and a nature-inspired ambiance. It includes elements that promote mental well-being and provide sensory experiences, such as an aroma diffuser, synthetic grass, and ambient nature sounds.

### Key Features of Nature’s Haven

- **Lighting:** Emphasis on natural lighting with LED lights that mimic sunlight.
- **Seating:** Comfortable seating with acoustic insulation for privacy.
- **Sound Environment:** Ambient nature sounds to enhance relaxation.
- **Community Engagement:** Bulletin boards for positive messages and resources for calming activities.

## Success Metrics

To ensure the effectiveness of the redesigned wellness room, the project includes the following assessment metrics:

1. **Natural Green Coverage Ratio:** Target 12% coverage for optimal psychological benefits.
2. **Lighting Quality:** Test lighting levels to ensure they mimic natural light patterns.
3. **Sound Insulation:** Maintain sound levels between 45-50 dB for a quiet, distraction-free space.

## Conclusion

The Wellness Room Expansion Project is set to transform the Chestnut Residence’s wellness room into a versatile, nature-inspired environment conducive to relaxation and mental wellness. The implementation of Nature’s Haven is expected to significantly improve usage rates and contribute to the well-being of the university community.
